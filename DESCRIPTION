Description: testr is a set of tools for Bayesian analysis of randomized experiments (A/B tests).It uses an adaptive design (i.e. early stopping rules), allowing tests to end as early as possible. Currently supports probability models for binary data (e.g. retention, conversion metrics) as well as zero-inflated data (e.g. Lifetime value).
